Mall Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

This project groups mall customers into different categories based on their age, income, and spending score using a machine learning technique called K-Means Clustering.

📁 What’s Inside
The notebook:

Loads and shows the customer data

Uses graphs to explore patterns (like age vs spending)

Applies K-Means to group customers into clusters

Finds the best number of groups using the Elbow Method

Shows the clusters visually with clear charts

📊 Data Used
The dataset is called Mall_Customers.csv and it contains:

CustomerID – unique customer ID

Gender – Male or Female

Age – Customer's age

Annual Income (k$) – Income in thousands

Spending Score (1-100) – Score based on customer behavior

🧰 Tools and Libraries
This project uses:

Python

pandas and NumPy – for handling data

matplotlib and seaborn – for plotting graphs

scikit-learn – for K-Means Clustering
